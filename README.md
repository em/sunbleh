= Sunbleh

A lot of vim users are drawn down the path of using 256 color mode to get more colors.
The problem is that the ANSI 256 sacrifice mostly lightness and have oversaturated or undersaturated colors as a result.
When I first switched to vim from Textmate, I missed the nice pastels that I had in Textmate.

The solution I found, is to use ANSI 16 colors, use the closest color in a colorscheme as a pallete, and then customize them in my terminal for true 24 bit colors.
With 16 ansi colors, and 2 more (foreground/background) you have 18 colors. Which is more than any syntax highlighting colorscheme ever uses.

I use item2 so what's packaged here is both the vim colorscheme, and the associated item2 colorscheme.

I also tweaked the color over time to more liking, so it is not actually Sunburst.
